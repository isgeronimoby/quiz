    facebook.</p>

<h2>Why sign up?</h2>
<p>In order to redeem your rewards and interact with friend through the app.</p>

<h2>What does “install everton rewards app” mean?</h2>
<p>This means that in one click you can download our browser extension which works on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari
    (and Internet Explorer shortly) or our android browser app and ios browser then every time you shop online with our
    app, and you don’t have to be signed up or signed in for it to work!</p>

<h2>Does it cost me to download or use it?</h2>
<p>Nope. Not a penny, it is the retailer who makes the payment to your everton rewards account at no extra cost to you.
    This payment is built into the price of their products anyway so a £20 kettle from Amazon still costs you £20.
    Amazon then credit approx £1 to your reward account.</p>
