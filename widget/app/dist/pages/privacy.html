<h1>Loyalty Rewarded privacy notice</h1>

    and shared. We acknowledge that you place your trust in us to do this carefully and sensibly. This notice describes
    our privacy policy. By visiting Loyalty Rewarded, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in
    this Privacy Notice.</p>

<h2>Personal information about customers that we gather</h2>
<p>We use the information we learn from customers to help us improve the experience on our website and those of our
    partners where their services are enabled or powered by Loyalty rewarded (the websites), personalise content that
    you see, and make sure you get the best value from Loyalty Rewarded. This information is used to manage and maintain
    your account, display content which is always relevant and appropriate to you, to manage and fulfil transactions
    that you make on the site, and to make recommendations and display other services that might be of interest to you.
    We also use this information to further develop and improve our service generally, to detect and prevent fraud and
    other abuse of our website, and to enable partners to perform a number of technical functions on our behalf.</p>

<h2>We gather information in a number of ways:</h2>

<h2>From you:</h2>
<p>We receive and can store information you enter on our website and that you give us in other ways. If you decide not
    to provide certain information there may be features of our website that do not work to full advantage for you. The
    information you provide is used to streamline your experience, customise certain functionality, improve our sites
    and communicate with you.</p>

<h2>Automatically:</h2>
<p>When you use our websites certain types of information are received automatically, for example through the use of
    cookies. This information can help us improve your experience and we may collect such information when your web
    browser accesses our site or advertisements or other content that is served by or on behalf of Loyalty Rewarded on
    other sites.</p>

<h2>Via e-mail:</h2>
<p>We may receive confirmation when you open email from us and can also collect information from your interaction with
    those emails. We work hard to avoid sending unnecessary messages, including by comparing our customer lists to those
    of our partners. If you do not wish to receive email from us our unsubscribe process is simple to follow. Log in to

<p>There are certain functions where we employ the services of other companies to perform those functions. This might be
    the processing of credit card payments and uploads, fulfilling and delivering orders, sending and processing of
    communications including email, or the cleaning and maintaining of our data files. These companies are only given
    access to personal information in order to perform their specific function and are never allowed to use it for other
    purposes. We also ensure that they comply with industry best practice and the UK data protection act.</p>

<h2>Via business transfers:</h2>
<p>From time to time we may require or sell segments or parts of our and others' businesses. On such occasions, customer
    information is likely to be one of the core assets of the business involved and as such may enter or leave our
    business accordingly. That information will always remain protected by this and any other existing privacy
    policy.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Loyalty Rewarded and partners take the issue of child protection and general use of the Internet by children very

    below the age of 13 should only use the website with the involvement and approval of a parent or guardian. Loyalty
