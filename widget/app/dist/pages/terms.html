<h2>B. Using LoyaltyRewarded.com</h2>

<h2>Loyalty Rewarded's Role</h2>

<p>Loyalty Rewarded allows third party sellers (partners) to display and make available for sale their products via the
    Loyalty Rewarded affiliate programme and similarly via its partners’ websites. This will be indicated on the
    respective product detail page. While Loyalty Rewarded as platform provider helps facilitate transactions that are
    carried out on the Loyalty Rewarded platform, Loyalty Rewarded is neither the buyer nor the seller of the seller's
    items. Loyalty Rewarded provides a venue for sellers and buyers to agree and complete transactions. Therefore, the
    contract formed at the completion of a sale for these third party products is entirely between buyer and seller. For
    the avoidance of doubt, Loyalty Rewarded is not a party to this contract and will not or cannot assume any
    responsibility arising out of or in connection with it. The seller is responsible for the sale of the products and
    for dealing with any buyer claims or any other issue arising out of or in connection with the contract between the
    buyer and seller.</p>

<h2>Reviews, comments, communications and other content</h2>

<p>Users of the website(s) may post reviews, comments and other content; send communications, invitations; share content
    and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, as long as the content is not illegal,
    obscene, abusive, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or
    otherwise injurious to third parties, or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses,
    political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam." You may not use
    a false email address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of any content.
    Loyalty Rewarded reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit any content.</p>

<p>If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you</p>

<p>(a) grant Loyalty Rewarded and its partners a non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sub-licensable rights to use,
    reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content
    throughout the world in any media; and</p>

<p>(b) grant Loyalty Rewarded and its partners and sub-licensees the right to use the name that you submit in
    connection with such content, if they choose.</p>

<p>You agree that the rights you grant above are irrevocable during the entire period of protection of your intellectual
    property rights associated with such content and material. You agree to waive your right to be identified as the
    author of such content and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such content. You agree to perform all
    further acts necessary to perfect any of the above rights granted by you to Loyalty Rewarded, including the
    execution of deeds and documents, at the request of Loyalty Rewarded.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that, as
    at the date that the content or material is submitted to LoyaltyRewarded.com: (i) the content and material is
    accurate; (ii) use of the content and material you supply does not breach any applicable Loyalty Rewarded policies
    or guidelines and will not cause injury to any person or entity (including that the content or material is not
    defamatory). You agree to indemnify Loyalty Rewarded and its affiliates and partners for all claims brought by a
    third party against Loyalty Rewarded or its affiliates and partners arising out of or in connection with a breach of
    any of these warranties.</p>


<h2>C. Trading with/on Loyalty Rewarded</h2>

<h2>Conditions Relating to the Sale of Products to You</h2>

<p>This section deals with conditions relating to the sale of products by Loyalty Rewarded affiliate partners to you,
    where these sales have been enabled by and conducted via the Loyalty Rewarded service.</p>

<p>There will be no direct contract created between the user making the purchase and Loyalty Rewarded. The contract of
    sale will be between the user and the partner who is selling the product. Each affiliate partner has their own terms
    and conditions which will be prominently displayed and easily accessible on their own sites and also as part of the
    order process. However, Loyalty Rewarded takes endeavours to protect the best interests of its users and to ensure
    they are provided with terms and conditions that comply with industry best practice. While varying by partner, the
    minimum standards Loyalty Rewarded expects from its partners are as follows:</p>

<h2>The contract</h2>

<p>When you place an order to purchase a product from a Loyalty Rewarded affiliate partner, the partner will send you an
    email confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order. Your order represents an offer to
    the partner to purchase a product which is accepted by the partner when it sends email confirmation to you that they
    have dispatched that product to you. That acceptance will be complete at the time the partner sends that email to
    you. Any products on the same order, which the partner has not confirmed have been dispatched in such a confirmation
    email, do not form part of that contract.</p>

<h2>Returns</h2>

<p>Each partner has their own specific returns policy that can be viewed on their own website and also accessed via the
    confirmation of purchase sent to the user. In addition to those specific terms, customers in the European Union are
    entitled to a statutory cooling-off period of seven business days. Details of this statutory right and an
    explanation of how to exercise it are accessible from the order confirmation email.</p>

<h2>Online Shopping</h2>

<p>When shopping online via Loyalty Rewarded affiliate partners, you will also be raising money for your chosen charity
    or other good cause. We have agreements in place with all our affiliate shopping partners that a small percentage of
    the value of your order will be paid as a commission to Loyalty Rewarded. While these commission rates vary
    according to the partner, Loyalty Rewarded commits that a portion of that commission will be passed directly to the
    partner’s nominated charity or foundation.</p>

<h2>Payment Schedule</h2>

<p>Loyalty Rewarded always seeks to remit money to charities as rapidly as possible. However, no money can or will be
    paid across to charities until it has been received by Loyalty Rewarded from the partner retailers. This will often
    include a waiting period to allow of permitted returns period and also for their own internal accounting
    systems.</p>

<h2>Other Payment Terms</h2>

<p>In some cases, Loyalty Rewarded depends upon retail partners to track and report sales made to consumers via their
    partnership with us. We cannot be held responsible if the retailer fails to report a sale to us. All retailers have
    their own rules upon which they determine transactions to be genuine. For example, an attempt to earn money simply
    by clicking/registering with no intention to continue to use/buy from their website could be deemed as non-genuine.
    These rules may or may not be advertised by ourselves or the retailer and may be discretionary.</p>

<p>We will always endeavour to recover non-payments from the retailer, the decisions by ourselves, the retailer or
    retailers tracking agent is final. Whilst we will try and recover missing commissions, at any point we reserve the
    right not to chase missing commission payments, particularly where no purchase is made. If missing payments are paid
    later by the retailer then the appropriate payment will be made to the nominated charity. We will always pay amounts
    due where money has been received from a retailer and tracked to a consumer’s account provided so long as that
    account with us remains active, the transactions are deemed by ourselves and the retailers to be genuine and the
    terms of the payment to the retailer are met.</p>

<p>Loyalty Rewarded reserves the right to reclaim or make appropriate balance adjustments where it has been established
    that any credit has been applied, or payment made, in error. This will include but is not limited to transactions
    where the credit is not genuinely due or payment for any credited transaction has not been received from a merchant
    or its agencies.</p>
